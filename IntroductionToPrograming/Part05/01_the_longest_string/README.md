# The longest string

Please write a function named longest(strings: list), which takes a list of strings as its argument. The function finds and returns the longest string in the list. You may assume there is always a single longest string in the list.

An example of expected behaviour:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    strings = ["hi", "hiya", "hello", "howdydoody", "hi there"]
    print(longest(strings))
```

```markdown
howdydoody
```
