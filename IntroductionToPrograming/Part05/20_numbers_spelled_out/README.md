# Numbers spelled out

Please write a function named dict_of_numbers(), which returns a new dictionary. The dictionary should have the numbers from 0 to 99 as its keys. The value attached to each key should be the number spelled out in words. Please have a look at the example below:

```python
numbers = dict_of_numbers()
print(numbers[2])
print(numbers[11])
print(numbers[45])
print(numbers[99])
print(numbers[0])
```

```markdown
two
eleven
forty-five
ninety-nine
zero
```

NB: Please don't formulate each spelled out number by hand. Figure out how you can use loops and dictionaries in your solution.
