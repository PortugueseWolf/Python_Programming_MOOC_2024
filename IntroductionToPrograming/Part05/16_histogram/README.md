# Histogram

Please write a function named histogram, which takes a string as its argument. The function should print out a histogram representing the number of times each letter occurs in the string. Each occurrence of a letter should be represented by a star on the specific line for that letter.

For example, the function call histogram("abba") should print out

```markdown
a **
b **
```

while histogram("statistically") should print out

```markdown
s **
t ***
a **
i **
c *
l **
y *
```
