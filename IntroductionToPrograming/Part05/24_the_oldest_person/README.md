# The oldest person

Please write a function named oldest_person(people: list), which takes a list of tuples as its argument. In each tuple, the first element is the name of a person, and the second element is their year of birth. The function should find the oldest person on the list and return their name.

An example of the function in action:

```python
p1 = ("Adam", 1977)
p2 = ("Ellen", 1985)
p3 = ("Mary", 1953)
p4 = ("Ernest", 1997)
people = [p1, p2, p3, p4]

print(oldest_person(people))
```

```markdown
Mary
```
