# Times ten

Please write a function named times_ten(start_index: int, end_index: int), which creates and returns a new dictionary. The keys of the dictionary should be the numbers between start_index and end_index inclusive

The value mapped to each key should be the key times ten.

For example:

```python
d = times_ten(3, 6)
print(d)
```

```markdown
{3: 30, 4: 40, 5: 50, 6: 60}
```
