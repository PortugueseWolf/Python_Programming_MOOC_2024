# Spell checker

Please write a program which asks the user to type in some text. Your program should then perform a spell check, and print out feedback to the user, so that all misspelled words have stars around them. Please see the two examples below:

```markdown
Write text: We use ptython to make a spell checker

We use *ptython* to make a spell checker
```

```markdown
Write text: This is acually a good and usefull program

This is *acually* good and *usefull* program
```
The case of the letters should be irrelevant to the functioning of your program.

The exercise template includes the file wordlist.txt, which contains all the words the spell checker should accept as correct.

**NB**: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions, so you should **not** place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.

**NB2** If Visual Studio can't find the file and you have checked that there are no spelling errors, take a look at these instructions.
