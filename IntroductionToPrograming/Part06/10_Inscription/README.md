# Inscription

Please write a program which asks for the name of the user and then creates an "inscription" in a file specified by the user. Please see the example below.

```markdown
Whom should I sign this to: Ada
Where shall I save it: inscribed.txt
```

The contents of the file inscribed.txt would be

```markdown
Hi Ada, we hope you enjoy learning Python with us! Best, Mooc.fi Team
```

**NB**: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions, so you should **not** place any code within an if __name__ == "__main__" block.
