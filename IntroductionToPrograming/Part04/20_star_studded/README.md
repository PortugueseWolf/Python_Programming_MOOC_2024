# Star-studded

Please write a program which asks the user to type in a string. The program then prints each input character on a separate line. After each character there should be a star (*) printed on its own line.

This is how it should work:

```markdown
Please type in a string: Python
P
*
y
*
t
*
h
*
o
*
n
*
```

**NB**: this exercise doesn't ask you to write any functions, so you should **not** place any code within an if name == "main" block.
