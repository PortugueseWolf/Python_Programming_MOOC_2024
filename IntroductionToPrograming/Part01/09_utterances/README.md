# Fix the code - Utterances

Here is a program which should ask for three utterances and print them out, like so:

```markdown
The 1st part: hickory
The 2nd part: dickory
The 3rd part: dock
hickory-dickory-dock!
```

However, there is something wrong with the code below. Please fix it.

```python
# Fix the code
part = input("The 1st part: ")
part = input("The 1st part: ")
part = input("The 1st part: ")
print(part + part + part)

```
