# Arithmetics

This program already contains two integer variables, x and y:

```markdown
x = 27
y = 15
```

Please complete the program so that it also prints out the following:

Sample output
```markdown
27 + 15 = 42
27 - 15 = 12
27 * 15 = 405
27 / 15 = 1.8
```

The program should work correctly even if the values of the variables are changed. That is, if the first two lines are replaced with this

```markdown
x = 4
y = 9
```

the program should print out the following:

Sample output

```markdown
4 + 9 = 13
4 - 9 = -5
4 * 9 = 36
4 / 9 = 0.4444444444444444
```
