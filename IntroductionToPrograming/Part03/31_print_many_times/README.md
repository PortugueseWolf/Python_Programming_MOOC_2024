# Print many times

Please write a function named print_many_times(text, times), which takes a string and an integer as arguments. The integer argument specifies how many times the string argument should be printed out:

```python
print_many_times("hi", 5)

print()

text = "All Pythons, except one, grow up"
times = 3
print_many_times(text, times)
```

```markdown
hi
hi
hi
hi
hi

All Pythons, except one, grow up.
All Pythons, except one, grow up.
All Pythons, except one, grow up.
```
