# How old

Please write a program which asks the user for their date of birth, and then prints out how old the user was on the eve of the new millennium. The program should ask for the day, month and year separately, and print out the age in days. Please have a look at the examples below:

```markdown
Day: 10
Month: 9
Year: 1979
You were 7417 days old on the eve of the new millennium.
```

```markdown
Day: 28
Month: 3
Year: 2005
You weren't born yet on the eve of the new millennium.
```
