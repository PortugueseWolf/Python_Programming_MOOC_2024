# Grades and points

The table below outlines the grade boundaries on a certain university course. Please write a program which asks for the amount of points received and then prints out the grade attained according to the table.

|< 0 | impossible!
|0-49 | fail
|50-59 | 1
|60-69 | 2
|70-79 | 3
|80-89 | 4
|90-100 | 5
