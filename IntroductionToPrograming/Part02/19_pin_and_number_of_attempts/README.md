# PIN and number of attempts

Please write a program which keeps asking the user for a PIN code until they type in the correct one, which is 4321. The program should then print out the number of times the user tried different codes.

```markdown
PIN: 3245
Wrong
PIN: 1234
Wrong
PIN: 0000
Wrong
PIN: 4321
Correct! It took you 4 attempts
```

If the user gets it right on the first try, the program should print out something a bit different:

```markdown
PIN: 4321
Correct! It only took you one single attempt!
```
