# Age of maturity

Please write a program which asks the user for their age. The program should then print out a message based on whether the user is of age or not, using 18 as the age of maturity.

Some examples of expected behaviour:

```markdown
How old are you? 12
You are not of age!
```

```markdown
How old are you? 32
You are of age!
```
